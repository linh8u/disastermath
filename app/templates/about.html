    <p class="normal">Currently, no open-source, comprehensive disaster dataset exists. Additionally, those in existence each use different standards and classifications. DisasterMath is a summer project whose initial goal was to examine how technology and innovation has, hopefully, reduced deaths and monetary damage. The first step was to begin curating existing data into a comprehensive dataset that includes disasters, their severity, and their impact (deaths, affected, monetary damage). As technology has progressed and the amount of data available increases, countries should be able to compare the relative impact of disasters. For example, were the Southern California fires deadlier than the Black Saturday bushfires in Australia? Were certain policies more helpful in mitigating loss? <br>
	<br>
	Another step in this process included categorizing similar countries based on development level. After all, it is not reasonable to compare a 7.0 earthquake in Japan with an 7.0 earthquake in Haiti. For this task, data from the <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator"> Wold Bank Development Indicators </a> was used to determine a country's development level. A country's development was calculated using <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.XPD.PCAP"> health expenditures </a>, <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD"> GDP </a>, <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.PRM.NENR"> school enrollment</a>, and communications. Communications consists of <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IT.MLT.MAIN.P2"> telephone lines </a>, <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IT.CEL.SETS.P2"> mobile phone subscriptions </a>, and <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IT.NET.USER.P2"> internet users</a>. </p>
