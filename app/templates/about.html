<p class="large">My interest in disasters stems from several things,
specifically: an influx in lack of aid coordination (an example being
Malaysia's refusal to allow NGO's post-tsunami), wanting to learn from
disasters both as individual events and total trends, and, lastly, from living
in the San Francisco Bay Area &mdash; which is prone to earthquakes.</p>
