    available with disaster information. And, those in existence each used
    different standards and classifications. The dataset now made available has
    been curated from the USGS, Global Active Archive of Large Flood Events, the
    Smithsonian's Volcano data, and Wildfire: News.</p>
    <p class="large">The dataset also contains a Development Index composed of
    health expenditures per capita, primary school enrollment, GDP, and
